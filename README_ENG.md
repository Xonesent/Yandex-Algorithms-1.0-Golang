I started my journey into the Go programming language with the Yandex Algorithms 1.0 course. It was definitely not an easy point due to its complexity and the basis for entering an internship a couple of years ago.

I can claim to have successfully completed the course. I found it difficult at first, as I didn't even understand how to set up the stdin stream. I used both the os.Open and ioutil.ReadFile methods until I finally realized that fmt.Scan worked too.

In the initial stages, my toolkit was meager, so I had to peek in the wizards. At the time, there was only one repository on GitHub containing the solutions to the first four homework assignments, and I'm quite grateful to its author. Nevertheless, I managed more than 80% of the assignments on my own, and my conscience doesn't bother me much.

Now I realize how sad it is when the code seems to be perfect but an error pops up on the 38th test without explanation. The most depressing case was when this error occurred because of a mistake of writing ">=" instead of ">"

I'm very happy that I succeeded in getting into 21 schools, but because of that I don't have enough time to solve the 7th homework (I found the 7th one the hardest, even the last one was easier). I hope I can get back to solving them later.
